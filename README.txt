7-Up is a game made in Python.

Essentially, you have to count up against the CPU and for every number that contains "7" or is a factor of 7, you will have to return 
"7-Up"

This is my first personal Python project for fun which means there will be many issues or better ways to code that I will not know. Will take feedback.
